# Robot yukari

### About
This is a simple process which can be deployed on a linux/macOS machine.
It is aimed at providing FF14 related information gathered 
from the Internet to all the members in the QQ group.  The project is
not well designed under 'object-orientation', and it is not designed for highly
concurrent occasions. Feel free to clone and deploy it on your machine for personal 
and lite use.


Actually, there have been several FF14 QQ robots released before mine.
[TATA](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=14726260&rand=978);
[TATARU](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=14654174&rand=524) More fancy
functions are provided.  However, for limited resources, it may be difficult to
have a chance to get one.  That is why I decided to construct my own project.

Thanks to Bluefissure and his source code.  I have learnt a lot from his code.
Here is his robot [TATA](https://github.com/Bluefissure/FFXIVBOT/) on github.
